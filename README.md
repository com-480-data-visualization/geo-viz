## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

This project aims at displaying useful information for a trip on an interactive world map. Selected countries will show information (tourism data, UNESCO world heritage locations, average temperature, mean expenditure of stay, ...) in a single click and will also be displayed in different colors according to various criteria (selected by the user), so you can have an idea at a glance. 

It would also be interesting to add the carbon footprint of the flight alongside the other information so the user can be aware of this when looking for their next trip. This part would be done using an API that computes the carbon footprint for us ([Carbon Footprint](https://connect.myclimate.org/api-overview)).

As a bonus, we also had the idea of plotting a treemap ([Treemap example](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)) chart per attribute to visualize the countries advantages in an unconventional way.
The project aims at making it simple to plan your next trip while keeping track of different parameters that might affect the selected destination. The target audience for this project is travelers in general, but also those who are concerned about their ecological footprint and still want to travel. 


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
